# Connect wallet with TypeScript

## How to use

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).
